So, imagine ping-pong (or air-hockey) but with charged particles... In other words, a game-field with attraction-repulsion fields inside. This is sort of what is happening here.

Instructions:

0. Go to https://yjmantilla.github.io/fields_hockey/
1. The ping-pong ball is the green one. Red and Blue circles just attract and repel respectively.
2. Click on 'Open Controls' to edit gameplay.
3. For Human Playing Click on 'Strikers' and choose anything besides cpu for each side.
4. You can experiment by clicking on 'Attractors and Repulsors' and then click on 'Repopulate with settings'.
5. Enjoy!

This was a little project I made to experiment with the Entity-Component-System programming paradigm within javascript.
